        <h1>Thoughts on Today's Verse...
            Paul wrote these words to the Christians at Colossae, but he had never been there. Despite his lack of "in-person" knowledge of them, he ministered effectively to them. He prayed specifically for them to better know God and his will. He assured them that they received the complete message of the gospel of Jesus when Epaphras preached it to them (Colossians 1:7, 4:12). What a great idea! Let's find a mission church (inner city, overseas, or planted in a hostile environment) and pray consistently for that congregation, asking God to help them know him, know his will more perfectly, and reassure them of his love for them.</h1>

<h2>My Prayer...
    Holy and all-powerful God, bless my church family with a deeper knowledge and appreciation of your nature, character, and grace. In addition, please bless mission churches and those working with them (add your mission church of choice). Bless them with growth, health, assurance, and, most of all, knowledge of you. In Jesus' name, I pray. Amen.

<P>Today's Verse In-Context</P>
    <p>15 And he died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again.</p>
    <p>16 So from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view. Though we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer.</p>
    <p>17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!</p>
    <p>18 All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation:</p>
    <p>19 that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting peopleâ€™s sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation.</P>
